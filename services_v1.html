                    <h5>RHINOPLASTY (NOSE JOB)</h5>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">As is so often the case in nature, form follows function. What we
                      require from our nose is that (A) it works well and (B) it looks good!</p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">The most likely reason why your nose is not the perfect shape is
                      because of a structural problem within that may eventually lead to a functional problem too. Of
                      all cosmetic operations, a rhinoplasty (nose job) is undoubtedly the most challenging. A nose
                      operation is a delicate procedure and requires the expertise and skills of an ENT (ear, nose and
                      throat) surgeon with a particular interest and training in this procedure, it is not for the
                      occasional rhinoplasty surgeon.</p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">The ENT surgeon is uniquely placed to deal with both the
                      requirements of the nose. Failing to correct the functional components, it is unlikely that the
                      cosmetic aspect can be adequately addressed either.</p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">Before and after photographs of other rhinoplasty patients with
                      similar issues may be discussed with you. We do not endorse the use of morphing picture
                      technology; substantial research shows this can lead to unrealistic expectations from patients.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">Rhinoplasty surgery is typically carried out under general
                      anaesthetic with a recommended overnight stay in the hospital. A plaster cast is normally placed
                      on the nose at the completion of the operation, and should remain on for a week postoperatively.
                      Preoperatively you will be informed about how to care for your nose post surgery - both on the day
                      of the consultation and on the day of the surgery.</p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">Written instructions are provided postoperatively too. Your surgeon
                      will visit you after the operation and prior to you being discharged. You can expect the surgeon
                      to remove your cast at the first postoperative visit that takes place one week after the surgery.
                      Postoperative photographs are usually taken after one month.</p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">You can be assured that nose reconstruction surgery is far less
                      painful than you might imagine, although adequate analgesia is provided for pain when you are
                      discharged after the surgery. It is usually a requirement to rinse the nose with a saline solution
                      for a few weeks after the operation and for you to take care of any suture lines present for at
                      least the first week. This information is also thoroughly explained and reiterated in the
                      postoperative instruction sheet. Patients may expect some bruising under the eyes for the first
                      week postoperatively.</p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2"><b>What you can expect to look like one week after the operation,
                        the day your cast will come off:</b></p>

                    <h5>SINONASAL SURGERY</h5>

                    <p class="mad_text_style2">Sinusitis is the second most frequent infection in the body after the
                      common cold. There are a number of reasons for this, but certainly the complexity of the anatomy
                      and function of the sinuses play a big part. All sinuses require adequate ventilation to prevent
                      infection and inflammation.</p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">Our western lifestyle unfortunately adds to the problem as we have become
                      sedentary in both our working environment and in how we spend our leisure time.</p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">We all know that our bodies require us to exercise. This is important for
                      our musculoskeletal system so it can stay healthy and we can decongest our nose and sinuses so
                      that fresh air can enter through the very small orifices into the cavities.</p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">A sinus infection occurs when there is an inflammation or swelling in the
                      sinuses â€“ hollow spaces in your skull that are connected to each other. The swelling can prevent
                      the flow of mucus which can lead to pain around your face and eyes. The philosophy on the
                      management of chronic sinusitis is to treat the condition medically, and if this is unsuccessful,
                      as a last resort, to consider sinonasal surgery.</p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">The history of a patient with sinusitis presents a key component of the
                      preoperative evaluation. Before one considers sinonasal surgery, a thorough diagnostic examination
                      will be undertaken. The development of diagnostic tools such as the fiberoptic endoscope and CT
                      scanning has greatly improved the treatment of sinus disease. The specific features that will be
                      observed and evaluated will include the middle turbinate and the middle meatus, any anatomical
                      obstruction, and the presence of pus and nasal polyps. CT scanning is also used to identify the
                      disease.</p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">Patients can also expect to be informed about how to live a healthier
                      lifestyle and how to sensibly use medication based on the clinical findings at the time of the
                      assessment.</p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">Sinonasal surgery is a minimally invasive surgical procedure that opens
                      up sinus air cells and sinus ostia (openings) with an endoscope. The purpose of sinus surgery is
                      to restore normal drainage of the sinuses. Normal functioning of the sinuses requires ventilation
                      through the ostia (mouth-like opening) and is facilitated by a mucociliary transport process that
                      maintains a constant flow of mucus out of the sinuses. The greatest symptom reduction is seen with
                      primary surgery for patients with extensive nasal polyposis.</p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">Surgical management of sinusitis has come a long way in the last 20
                      years, and is no longer the legendary painful, bloody procedure of yore.Sinonasal surgery is
                      generally safe and effective.</p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">Typically you will be admitted on the day of your surgery, and can expect
                      to stay overnight. A sinus operation takes place through the nostrils, without any cuts and rarely
                      some bruising around the eyes. No packing is used in the nose postoperatively.</p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">The postoperative pain is minimal and usually controlled with codeine and
                      an anti-inflammatory. You will be asked to flush your nose continuously for at least one week
                      after the operation. We also advice that the patient takes a week off work.</p>

                    <h5>LARYNGOLOGY</h5>

                    <p class="mad_text_style2">Laryngology is a branch of medicine that addresses injuries, disorders
                      and diseases of the larynx (also referred to as the voice box). Several disorders of the larynx
                      can be caused by strain or injury to the vocal cords through excessive talking, throat clearing,
                      coughing, smoking, screaming, singing and speaking too loudly.</p>

                      <li><p>Vocal cord nodules â€“ small, benign growths on the vocal cords.</p></li>
                      <li><p>Vocal cord polyps â€“ this is similar to a vocal nodule, but softer and more blister-like.</p></li>
                      <li><p>Vocal cord hemorrhage â€“ a sudden loss of voice, usually due to screaming, shouting or other

                      <li><p>Spasmodic dysphonia â€“ people with this condition experience spasm of one or more muscles of
                        the larynx. This can cause difficulty in speech.</p></li>
                      <li><p>Professional voice disorders â€“ many people who use their voices for a living may experience
                        either temporary or more long-lasting problems with their voices.</p></li>
                      <li><p>Laryngopharyngeal reflux disease (LPRD) â€“ This condition is also more commonly referred to as
                        heartburn, acid reflux disease or gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD).</p></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="mad_text_style2">The study of the voice has made great strides over the last few decades.
                      This is mainly due to the advancement in technology and the ability to push boundaries when
                      analysing and managing the larynx. Greater cooperation between the laryngologist, speech
                      therapist, voice coach and voice scientist has given all parties a deeper insight into how to
                      diagnose and manage voice problems.</p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">Treatments for conditions that affect the larynx vary depending on your
                      diagnosis. Surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy or a combination of these treatments may be
                      used to treat laryngeal cancer. Surgery may also be required to treat nodules, polyps and cysts.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">From the voice specialistâ€™s perspective, the biggest advancement has been
                      the advent of the videostroboscope. This tool allows for real-time evaluation of the voice. By
                      making use of stroboscopic light, vocal cord movement in all its intricacies can routinely be
                      evaluated in the specialistâ€™s room, and the video produced then discussed with the patient.</p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">The number of people who use their voices professionally has grown
                      exponentially. Apart from singers and performers, many people earn their living today by giving
                      presentations and speaking all day â€“ especially in the corporate sector.</p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">All professional voice users can potentially develop problems with their
                      larynx due to an assault on this area from other parts of the body - reflux from the stomach, an
                      infective post nasal drip or strain on the organ from overuse.</p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">Our practice has a state-of-the-art videostroboscope that enables us to
                      make an accurate diagnosis of the most subtle problem. Dr Martin Vanlierde has been Consultant of
                      the Voice Clinic at Groote Schuur Hospital and the University of Cape Town Medical School for the

                    <h5>SNORING SURGERY</h5>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">Snoring is a common condition that can affect anyone, although it occurs
                      more often in men and unfortunately worsens with age. Research reveals that twenty percent of men
                      snore at the age of twenty and approximately sixty percent of men snore at the age of sixty.</p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">An unpleasant situation occurs when the snoring problem becomes so
                      excessive that your sleeping partner is constantly disturbed when trying to sleep. It is usually
                      at this stage that both sufferer and sleeping partner will be impacted by poor quality sleep
                      patterns. Medical assistance is often needed for habitual snorers and their loved ones in order to
                      get a good nightâ€™s rest.</p>

                    <h6>Causes</h6>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">Snoring usually occurs when the flow of air through the mouth and nose is
                      physically obstructed. This can be caused by factors such as: obstructed nasal air passages, poor
                      muscle tone in the throat and tongue, bulky throat tissue or a long soft palate at the back of the
                      mouth that can narrow the opening from the nose to the throat.</p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">Lifestyle is also a contributing factor. The consumption of alcohol at
                      night and the use of drugs such as marijuana will suppress your respiratory drive and put you into
                      a deeper sleep which will cause your snoring to increase. A person generally snores more
                      excessively when they are very tired.</p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">The good news is that all of the above factors are reversible by simply
                      making a few adjustments to your lifestyle. However, there are certain causes of snoring that can
                      be assisted by judicious surgery only. Difficulties usually arise in three areas: the nose and
                      sinuses, the nasopharynx and throat, and the oral cavity and oropharynx.</p>

                    <h6>Treatment</h6>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">The ENT (ear, nose and throat) surgeon has unique expertise in
                      identifying snoring concerns and can recommend a suitable treatment for snoring.</p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">Nasal and sinus concerns are usually addressed first. Thereafter advice
                      regarding a lifestyle change is given and nasal sprays are recommended. If medical therapy does
                      not initially work, a further analysis is undertaken to determine whether possible surgical
                      treatment for snoring is required. This could include the management of a deviated nasal septum or
                      nasal polyps.</p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">The nasopharynx and throat may also require surgery, typically in the
                      form of the removal of adenoids and possibly tonsils.</p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">Concerns related to the oral cavity and oropharynx are dealt with in a
                      variety of ways:</p>

                    <ul class="default_list_square">
                      <li><p>surgery to the palate under local anaesthetic making use of a laser.</p></li>
                      <li><p>surgery to the palate and uvula under general anaesthetic.</p></li>
                      <li><p>Oral prostheses utilized to keep the tongue forward while sleeping.</p></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="mad_text_style2">Depending on your particular concern, the above remedies for snoring are
                      presented after which you will be guided with regards to your treatment options.</p>

                    <h5>ENDOSCOPIC DACROCYSTORHINOSTOMY (DCR)</h5>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">Endoscopic surgery is recommended in the treatment of tearing due to
                      nasolacrimal duct obstruction. In children, blockage of this duct can result from the failure of a
                      membrane at the end of the tear duct (Valve of Hasner) to open normally at or near the time of
                      birth. In adults this can result from inflammatory medical conditions, trauma or a tumour.
                      However, it most commonly occurs without an identifiable cause.</p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">Tear duct obstruction can be diagnosed by looking at a patientâ€™s history
                      of tearing and discharge at a very early age. One of the major factors in determining the success
                      rate of endoscopic dcr surgery is the level of obstruction in the lacrimal drainage system.</p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">The nasolacrimal duct is a small tube that connects the eyelids to the
                      inner nose, and has the role of acting like an inner drainage tube or â€˜gutterâ€™ for tears. Oneâ€™s
                      eyes need lubrication - the function of tears. This lubrication needs to be regularly changed, so
                      tears are continually produced and the excess goes down the nasolacrimal duct into the nose.</p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">This duct can get blocked, resulting in tears welling out of the eye down
                      the cheek, especially with cold weather. The problem is normally observed by the eye specialist
                      (Ophthalmologist) first, who will ensure that the concern is not related to any other eye related
                      condition. Traditionally they would repair the obstruction in the nasolacrimal duct by operating
                      externally through an incision on the cheek, between the eye and nose.</p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">Today the operation is usually performed by an ENT (ear, nose and throat)
                      surgeon who is trained to do the whole operation through the nose, thus avoiding the need to make
                      any cuts on the face. The endoscopic dcr operation is done under general anaesthesia, as a
                      day-care case (in and out the same day), and takes about forty five minutes. The objective of the
                      procedure is to bypass the obstructed nasolacrimal duct and allow for tear drainage into the nose
                      directly from the lacrimal sac.</p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">There is normally a little tube inserted as a stent in the nasolacrimal
                      duct which is left in place for some 6 weeks before being removed painlessly in the doctorâ€™s
                      rooms.</p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">The endoscopic approach ensures that pain is minimal and can be
                      controlled with mild prescription pain medication. Infection is uncommon, but many surgeons prefer
                      to administer antibiotics. There is no bruising or external evidence that surgery has been
                      performed. The endoscopic dcr technique is a safe, effective, low complication technique that
                      yields good aesthetical-functional results and shows a success rate similar to that of external
                      approach when performed by experienced surgeons. Other advantages include:</p>

                    <ul class="default_list_square">
                      <li><p>It allows a one-stage procedure to also correct associated nasal pathology that may be
                        causative</p></li>
                      <li><p>It is less bloody and messy than the external approach.</p></li>
                      <li><p>The success rate is comparable to the external approach.</p></li>
                      <li><p>It provides a better aesthetic result with no external scar.</p></li>
                      <li><p>It preserves the pumping mechanism of the orbicularis oculi muscle.</p></li>

                    <p class="mad_text_style2">General otolaryngology is the area of medicine that deals with the
                      conditions of the ear, nose and throat (ENT) region, and related areas of the head and neck. There
                      are seven areas of expertise in the field of otolaryngology:</p>

                    <ul class="default_list_square">
                      <li><p><b>Allergic Reactions:</b> The treatment by medication for the avoidance of pollen, dust,
                        mold, food, and other sensitivities that affect the ear, nose, and throat.</p></li>
                      <li><p><b>Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery:</b> The treatment of a deviated septum,
                        rhinoplasty (nose job), face lift, cleft palate, drooping eyelids and other ear deformities.
                      </p></li>
                      <li><p><b>Laryngology:</b> This refers to disorders such as a sore throat, hoarseness, swallowing
                        disorders, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), infections and tumors.</p></li>
                      <li><p><b>Otology/Neurotology:</b> This refers to the diseases of the ear, including trauma (injury),
                        infection, benign tumors and nerve pathway disorders which affect hearing and balance.</p></li>
                      <li><p><b>Pediatric Otolaryngology:</b> This relates to diseases in children with special ENT
                        problems including birth defects of the head and neck and developmental delays.</p></li>
                      <li><p><b>Rhinology:</b> Disorders of the nose and sinuses and treatment of sinus disorder, a nose
                        bleed, a stuffy nose, loss of smell, polyps and tumours.</p></li>
                      <li><p><b>Head and Neck:</b> cancerous and non-cancerous tumors in the head and neck (nose/sinuses,
                        mouth, throat, voice box and upper esophagus), including the thyroid and parathyroid.</p></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="mad_text_style2">The ENT (ear, nose and throat surgeon) surgeon differs from many other
                      physicians in that they are trained in both medicine and surgery. ENT surgeons do not need to
                      refer patients to other physicians when ear, nose, throat, or head/neck surgery is needed and can
                      offer the most personalised care for each individual patient.</p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">An ENT specialist also treats many common conditions like ear wax
                      impaction, ear infections, hearing loss, dizziness, and ringing in the ears (tinnitus). ENT
                      specialists are experts in treating sore throats, loss of voice, and any problems related to the
                      nose. This applies to both adults and children.</p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">At the outset, you will see your family doctor for most of these
                      problems, and if you are not getting any better, your family doctor will refer you on for further
                      evaluation and management of the problem.</p>

                    <h5>BOTOX THERAPY</h5>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">Botox is a drug that is manufactured from a neurotoxin produced by the
                      bacterium clostridium botulinum called cbotulinum toxin. This organism is found in the natural
                      environment where it is largely inactive and non-toxic. It is used medically to treat certain
                      muscular conditions and cosmetically to remove wrinkles by temporarily paralyzing muscles.</p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">Botox therapy is also used for the treatment of excessive sweating,
                      migraines, muscular disorders and some bladder and bowel disorders. Botulinum toxin, the most
                      potent known biological neurotoxin, holds a great promise in the therapy of many diseases. It has
                      also been used effectively to treat strabismus, dystonias and other movement disorders, and
                      spasticity.</p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">Amongst the most outstanding contributions to cosmetic therapy in the
                      last quarter century has been the development to use botulinum toxin for cosmetic applications.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">Botulinum toxin is injected with a fine needle into specific muscles with
                      only minor discomfort. It is administered in extremely small concentrations and works by blocking
                      signals from the nerves to the muscles. The injected muscle canâ€™t contract which makes the
                      wrinkles relax and soften.</p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">Botox is most commonly used on forehead wrinkles, the so called glabellar
                      frown and crows feet (lines around the eye). The injection only takes a few minutes and doesnâ€™t
                      require anesthesia. Generally, it takes three to seven days to take full effect, and it is best to
                      avoid alcohol starting at least one week before the procedure.</p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">There are many other successful applications of the neurotoxin around the
                      face and neck, along with fillers such as hyaluronic acid. The two make an ideal combination to
                      both enhance the results of cosmetic surgery or as treatment in their own right.</p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">In order for muscles to contract, nerves release a chemical messenger,
                      acetylcholine (a neurotransmitter), at the junction where the nerve endings meet muscle cells. The
                      acetylcholine attaches to receptors on the muscle cells and causes the muscle cells to contract or
                      shorten.</p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">Injected botulinum toxin prevents the release of acetylcholine,
                      preventing contraction of the muscle cells. The effect of botulinum toxin causes a reduction in
                      abnormal muscle contraction allowing the muscles to become less stiff. Wrinkles caused by sun
                      damage and gravity will not respond to botox.</p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">Today, botox is the most popular cosmetic surgery treatment, with more
                      than six million botox treatments performed each year.</p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">With the understanding that many wrinkles in the face occur due to the
                      overactive muscularture, the idea of paralyzing those muscles to allow the overlying skin to
                      smooth is brilliant, and has more than stood the test of time. Today millions of people annually
                      will consider botox therapy to improve their appearances. A botox injection usually lasts from
                      four to six months. As the muscle action gradually returns, the lines and wrinkles begin to
                      reappear and need to be treated again.</p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">Patients can expect temporary bruising which is the most common
                      side-effect and headaches which usually end within 24 to 48 hours â€“ but this is rare.</p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">Our practice offers botox therapy and fillers in the management of
                      wrinkles and creases.</p>

                    <h5>POST-TONSILLECTOMY INSTRUCTION</h5>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">Everyone gets a sore throat from time to time, and sometimes the tonsils
                      in your mouth can become infected. Tonsils are not the only vulnerable glands in your mouth.
                      Adenoids- which are located higher up in the mouth - can also get infected. Enlarged and inflamed
                      adenoids can make breathing difficult and lead to recurring respiratory infections and snoring.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">Tonsillectomy is a surgical procedure that is performed in order to have
                      the tonsils removed. The tonsils and adenoids are masses of lymphoid tissue located behind the
                      nasal passages. Infected or enlarged tonsils may cause a chronic sore throat, bad breath, abscess
                      and upper airway obstruction which may cause difficulty with swallowing, snoring or sleep apnea.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">The instructions below are designed to help you or a loved one recover
                      from surgery as painlessly as possible. Taking care of yourself or the individual having surgery
                      can prevent complications. As all surgical procedures have risks and potential complications, itâ€™s
                      important to understand what is involved before, during, and after surgery.</p>

                    <ul class="default_list_square">
                      <li><p>The patient must stay in bed on the day of being discharged from the hospital.</p></li>
                      <li><p>The patient may be allowed up (indoors) the day following the operation.</p></li>
                      <li><p>The patient may be allowed outside the following day, but must remain indoors at night for 10
                        days and off from work or school for seven days.</p></li>
                      <li><p>The pain after a tonsillectomy is due to stiffness of the throat muscles. The more that you
                        chew and eat, the sooner the pain will be relieved. Itâ€™s important to start eating solid foods
                        as soon as possible, e.g. bread and a full diet. Biltong is a good food to chew. A Panado or
                        another analgesic 30 minutes before a meal will relieve the pain and allow solid foods to be
                        ingested easier. Avoid eating bananas, acid or salty foods and condiments.</p></li>
                      <li><p>During the first postoperative week, a sore throat, earache and a slight rise in temperature
                        are normal responses and should not cause concern. If however these symptoms become severe or if
                        bleeding occurs and you become concerned in any way, please contact either your local GP or
                        myself.</p></li>
                      <li><p>The area from which the tonsils were removed will heal with the formation of a yellow scab.
                        This is a normal healing pattern, and does not indicate infection.</p></li>
                      <li><p>Days five to seven are the most painful postoperative days. Patients can expect earache and a
                        mild temperature. This can be treated with the pain medication prescribed at the time of
                        surgery.</p></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="mad_text_style2">Please expect a period of tiredness and irritability after surgery.
                      Whatever the effort made, having an operation is still a very stressful experience and rest,
                      healthy food, lots of fluids to drink and plenty of sleep will speed you towards recovery!</p>

                    <h5>NASAL SURGERY POST-OPERATIVE INSTRUCTIONS</h5>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">Now that your operation is over, you should expect to feel an improvement
                      in your symptoms as the operation area heals, and the swelling goes down. The following
                      instructions are designed to warn you about complications, how to avoid them and how to speed up
                      the healing process. Common complications include:</p>

                    <h6>Congestion</h6>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">This is a common side-effect and is to be expected. Use a decongestant
                      nose drop, e.g. Drixine or Iliadin three times a day if the congestion is particularly bad. Sleep
                      in a head up position â€“ i.e. use extra pillows. Avoid alcohol, very hot meals or drinks and
                      smoking. Use a nasal douche regularly â€“ see below for instructions.</p>

                    <h6>Bleeding</h6>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">A minor degree of bleeding is to be expected at intervals, but copious
                      bleeding should be reported either to your GP or to myself, particularly if the bleeding comprises
                      fresh blood and does not stop spontaneously.</p>

                    <ul class="default_list_square">
                      <li><p>Avoid blowing your nose forcibly for two weeks.</p></li>
                      <li><p>Avoid drugs like aspirin, which thin the blood and prevent it clotting.</p></li>
                      <li><p>Avoid lifting heavy objects and straining.</p></li>
                      <li><p>Do not do vigorous exercise for two weeks.</p></li>
                      <li><p>Do not move too far away from medical care for the first two weeks.</p></li>
                      <li><p>Donâ€™t bungee jump!!!</p></li>
                    </ul>

                    <h6>Scarring</h6>
                    <p class="mad_text_style">The inside of the nose can scar, causing adhesions. Old blood clots and
                      scabs will promote scarring, cause discomfort, promote infection and encourage bleeding if they
                      are not removed. To avoid this complication use the following solution as a nasal douche:</p>

                    <ul class="default_list_square">
                      <li><p>1 litre of cooled boiled water, but warmed to body temperature before use.</p></li>
                      <li><p>1 teaspoon salt.</p></li>
                      <li><p>Â½ teaspoon bicarbonate of soda.</p></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="mad_text_style2">Mix the solution together and keep it in the bathroom with a 20ml syringe
                      handy, or a manufactured bottle as given to you post-operatively. To use the solution you can bend
                      over a basin and syringe the fluid into the nose, aiming at the outer aspect of the eye so that
                      the solution can go into your sinuses due to gravity. After half a minute or so, sit up and let
                      the solution drain into the bowl â€“ you may blow.</p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">Your husband/wife/your partner or your kids will probably find this
                      exercise repulsive and will want to avoid you â€“ but please persevere. You may also try sniffing
                      this solution in the shower. You will find that long hot showers with gentle nose blowing in the
                      shower will also feel good and be beneficial</p>

                    <h6>Sinus Surgery</h6>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">Be aware that meningitis is a rare complication of sinus surgery. Any
                      high fever, vomiting, severe headache, pain resulting from looking into bright lights, fits or
                      confusion demands immediate attention either personally by me or by your GP. This condition is
                      easily treated when discovered early.</p>

                    <h6>Rhinoplasty Surgery</h6>
                    <p class="mad_text_style">You can expect bruising around the eyes to last for at least a week. A
                      daily walk will help to open the lymphatics and cut down on bruising and swelling. You can also
                      expect the plaster cast to get a little looser as the swelling reduces over a few days. Do not
                      wear glasses for two weeks after the surgery. Avoid sunlight for the first two weeks and please
                      use factor 30 or stronger sun block over the nose and face for one month after the surgery.</p>

                    <h6>Changes in Smell or Taste Changes</h6>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">This is due to congestion and should improve as the operation area heals.
                      Please expect to feel tired, irritable and possibly depressed after an operation â€“ it is after all
                      a strenuous experience. Plenty of rest, fluids, healthy food and sleep will rectify the situation.
                      The nose heals rapidly and complications are relatively infrequent.</p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">I would like to see you for a follow up every week until you have healed
                      â€“ the first few consultation fees are included in the fee for the operation. If you experience any
                      other problems at any time, please contact me on 082 425 8369.</p>
                    <p class="mad_text_style2">Have a speedy recovery!</p>

                    <h5>ADVICE ON GROMMETS</h5>
                    <p class="mad_text_style">Following on the insertion of grommets, there may be a discoloured
                      discharge from the ear canal. This will be a combination of blood, mucous and wax, and need not be
                      a concern. The discharge normally lasts a few days.</p>

                    <h6>Children under 4 years</h6>

                    <ul class="default_list_numb">
                      <li><p>Your child may swim and do all the water sports he/she wishes. It is advisable to not swim for
                        two weeks following on the insertion of the grommets, to allow the ears to settle.</p></li>
                      <li><p>Do not clean the ears with anything more than a wet face cloth; using ear buds normally only
                        leads to wax impaction.</p></li>
                    </ul>

                    <h6>Older Children</h6>

                    <ul class="default_list_numb">
                      <li><p>If your child is an active swimmer e.g. Swimming club, then earplugs are advised. A swimming
                        cap and cotton wool plug will also suffice.</p></li>
                      <li><p>Diving deep places increased pressure on the eardrum and may cause pain; it is essential to
                        use earplugs in this situation.</p></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="mad_text_style">The patient should be seeing either myself or your family doctor to have
                      the grommets checked approximately one week after the operation. If you have any concerns please
                      contact me. Intermittently the ears may discharge following on a cold. If this occurs, please
                      consult your GP or myself.</p>
